# This script generates a sysroot tarball for the el-7-ppc64 (aka
# Power 8) platform. For our builds we cross-compile most of our packages
# on a redhat-7-x86_64 pooler system, but the sysroot must be created
# from a native Power8 environment. Therefore, you must run this script
# as root on a Power8 server running RHEL 7.2.

# to get rid of unneeded library files and minmize the size of the sysroot,
# even though we'll still be pruning the libdirs in a later step.

# Note: we cannot remove libxml2-python, as it is in the dependency chain for
# subscription-manager, which we need to keep the yum repos enabled for this
# platform.
